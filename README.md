3D_Scene_Interalization

# 3D Scene Internalization

**Goal:** Pretrain **scene-specific latent representations** to avoid expensive online 3D reconstruction, while supporting **override conditioning** (e.g., blocked doorway, new room, moved objects) at inference.  
This hybrid paradigm â€” **internalized base memory + contextual overrides** â€” enables **fast navigation, planning, and reasoning** in known environments with the flexibility to handle local changes.

## Motivation

For many navigation, planning, and reasoning tasks, agents repeatedly re-embed and reconstruct the 3D world from scratch, which is computationally expensive.  
Instead, this project explores **parametric models that internalize a fixed set of target scenes**, enabling:

- **Fast path planning** in known layouts.
- **Scene override reasoning** to adapt to local changes without retraining.
- **Exploration & map updates** with efficient reuse of pretrained memory.
- **Multi-step reasoning** in tasks requiring persistent spatial memory.
- **Design & simulation** for evaluating alternative scene layouts.
